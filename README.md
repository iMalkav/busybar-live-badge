Captured from a physical BUSY Bar. See [capture details](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md)
for firmware, settings and sample-data provenance.

## Controls

OK refreshes. Back exits.

## Settings

Open **Apps → Live Badge → Setup**. Saved settings are read when the app starts.

| Setting | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source URL | string |  |
| Access token | string |  |
| Refresh (sec) | integer | 30 |

The source reports broadcast metadata. Authentication and provider-specific event subscriptions belong to the source adapter.

Access token is sent as a Bearer token. Configure URLs and credentials in the web settings. Remote sources require Wi-Fi.

Failed refreshes retain the last valid data and show an error. Values older than three refresh intervals are marked stale.

See [docs/DATA.md](docs/DATA.md) for the response format and [examples/response.json](examples/response.json) for a sample.

## Install and build

Use the Node.js version in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) and the pnpm version in [package.json](package.json).

    corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    corepack pnpm check
    corepack pnpm app:install
    corepack pnpm app:run

Pass --addr <host> to an app command to select a device. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
The minimum firmware HTTP API is specified in [src/appmeta/manifest.json](src/appmeta/manifest.json).

## Development

Each project contains its own runtime, state model, assets, tests and build scripts.
Run pnpm check for metadata validation, type checking, unit tests, packaging and bundle smoke checks.
Run pnpm release to prepare a versioned archive and SHA256SUMS locally.
Generated files under dist/ are excluded from Git.
